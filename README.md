This repository will contain projects that I would like to highlight.

🎀 Project Ribbon :

Project Ribbon is a game created with Unity during my studies at Humber College.
The project was to recreate a game. 

The game we decided to recreate was Hollow Knight.
The current gameplay loop of Project Ribbon is that casting spells does damage to the player, but the player can use a melee attack to replenish health.
 
Currently, there is a Pogo system, a Dash, 3 different enemy types and a final Boss. 

🏰 Chaotic Neutral :

Chaotic Neutral is a fantasy fighting game that was created for my Mid Stone project.
This game was made in C++, created using SDL.

Currently, this game contains a working menu, music, Character select, hit boxes, health bar and a mana bar.


🤿 Bus Divers :

Bus Divers is a game I created during the time I spent at the 48 Hours 2025 Global Game Jam.
 
The theme was bubbles, and we had to create a game with that theme. 

We ended up creating a 2D platformer, and the goal is to get to the end while avoiding obstacles 
and also before the player runs out of oxygen.

Currently, this game has a display to keep track of the player's oxygen, 
moving platforms, sea wips for the player to avoid, and a jet pack that consumes oxygen and nodes to refill your oxygen.
